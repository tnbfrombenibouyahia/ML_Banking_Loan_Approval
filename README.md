# ML_Banking_Loan_Approval
This project is a web-based application built with Flask ( First time :/ )  that leverages a machine learning model to predict whether a bank will approve or reject a loan application based on certain input variables.The goal of this application is to provide a simple and interactive interface for users to input relevant financial and personal details and receive an immediate prediction regarding their loan eligibility.

Features:

Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained logistic regression model is used to predict loan approval based on user inputs.
User-Friendly Interface: An easy-to-use web interface developed with HTML/CSS allows users to enter their details and view the prediction results.
Data Processing: User inputs are pre-processed and formatted for compatibility with the machine learning model.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language for the application.
Flask: A micro web framework used to build the web application and handle user requests.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for model training and prediction.
HTML/CSS: Front-end technologies for building the web interface.
Pickle: Python module used for serializing and deserializing the trained machine learning model.
